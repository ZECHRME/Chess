# Chess


It's in early development and has lots of bugs.... For now consider this as a virtual chess where you can cheat


For clicks, there's a bug that you can only move it by click if you click on the block the piece is at instead of clicking the piece.
It is totally opposite from when you drag the piece you need to click the svg instead of the block or it won't work
